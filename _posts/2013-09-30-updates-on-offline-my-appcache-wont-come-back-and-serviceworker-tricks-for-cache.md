My slides from my talk "Updates on Offline: “My AppCache won’t come back” and “ServiceWorker Tricks for Cache”" from Over the Air 2013 held in September in Bletchley Park. We had a good run-through of offline APIs in web, the mysteries of App Cache, and updates on the current status of ServiceWorker.
