title: "FrontEndLondon: ServiceWorker & the offline web"
author: "Tom Ashworth"

Native platforms hold something over the web: we do not have a meaningful way to ensure that, no matter what the connection of the user is like, we can always deliver code and content. ServiceWorker aims to fix this, allowing developers to take control of navigations and resource fetching before they go to the network. We'll go through the state of things today, look at the ServiceWorker proposal and try out the polyfill that you can use today.
