The [first draft of the service worker spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-service-workers-20140508/) was published today! It's been a collaborative effort between Google, Samsung, Mozilla and others, and implementations for Chrome and Firefox are being actively developed. Anyone interesting in the web competing with native apps should be excited by this.
