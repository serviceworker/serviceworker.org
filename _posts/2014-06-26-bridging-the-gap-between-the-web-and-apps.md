The web is getting new capabilities! In this tech talk we'll discuss some of the changes that are already available, such as background processing with Service Worker, and also give you a sneak peek at some new APIs we're testing out. Which APIs? You'll have to attend to find out. :) There are some cool demos in store for you and we'd love to get your feedback on our work as we test drive these new capabilities in the coming months.
