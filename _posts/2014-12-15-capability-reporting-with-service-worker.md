UA/device detection is a fact of life, a growing business, and an enabling business requirement for many. The problem is that UA/device detection often frequently misclassifies capable clients (e.g. IE11 was forced to change their UA); leads to compatibility nightmares; can't account for continually changing user and runtime preferences. That said, when used correctly it can also be used for good.
